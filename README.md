# AdvancedFresnelSegment

This fresnel effect has the possibility to segment the effect (see video), allow to you only apply the effect in a portion of the mesh, cool effect to create a fake rim or backlight, also it would be very useful in visual effects

With the new update you can use 3 Fresnel Functions:

- Schlick’s model from the book “The Renderman: Shading Language Guide” (Implemented by myself).

- Fresnel (Unreal Function)

- Standard Fresnel Func (Unreal Function)

- A ramp function that worked with 3 colors, great to create more amazing visuals.
